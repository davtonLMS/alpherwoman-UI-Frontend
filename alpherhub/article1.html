                                        <ul class="post-info pb-3">
                                            <li><a href="#">January 10, 2020</a></li>

                                        <p>In the summer of 2016, our office at JA Africa received a barrage of requests from students across Ghana looking for opportunities to join the organization as interns; to learn and to contribute towards a mission they care about. I was impressed by the quality of applications that we received and the assertiveness with which they were sent. In the end, after an extensive process we hired three interns.
                                        Our office is small, with very little room for everyone, and we have been intentional about cultivating a team culture which is inclusive and fun so we get to know each other well and quickly. We also learn a great deal from each other.</p>
                                        <p>For me, having the interns in the office has been an opportunity to relearn some lessons that I first learned long ago when I was an intern at the Carter Presidential Center in Atlanta, Georgia (USA). My experience there was memorable partly because of the things I learned, but mostly because meeting and working in the same vicinity as an American President was not within the scope of things a little girl from Africa could aspire to do in one lifetime. </p>
                                        <p>Though I hardly interacted with the President, I did learn some important lessons from him. I learned that leadership requires calm: President Carter always exuded a calming, reassuring presence that commanded authority. I also learned that great leadership requires humility: his aura was the opposite of everything I had imagined in a President. He is modest and understated, but none of that diminished his knowledge and influence. I remember with fondness and gratitude the many lessons from the different people I encountered during my internship there and gladly pass them on to another generation of young people. Though they are young and new to the workplace, there are many things our interns (and entry level staff) can teach us as executives:</p>
                                        <p>1. Enthusiasm is currency: Interns enter the workplace bright-eyed and full of enthusiasm about their work. This optimism and eagerness to learn, if channelled properly, can fuel other team members who may see the work as monotonous. Use the enthusiasm of your interns to power the rest of the team. Their willingness to try, make mistakes and stand to be corrected is an enviable trait. Just because it didn't work before doesn't mean it won't work if you try it again. Young people are curious by nature and seem generally unafraid to fail. The fear of failure, we know, is learned behaviour. So, before they encounter it in the workplace, senior managers can capitalize on their optimism.</p>
                                        <p> 2. Inexperience can be an asset: In the summer of 2016, I assigned everyone on my team a course in Project Management. Every Thursday for several weeks, we congregated in our tiny conference room, watched video lessons and debated the lessons we were learning. I have never seen my team be this passionate about something. They debated on and on, everyone got involved and just seeing how much boldness the interns exuded in this discourse forced team members to also make their thoughts known. Quieter members of my team became more vocal in these sessions as they created an environment where we could challenge each other. Creating the opportunity for collective learning evened the playing field. The workplace is a great school and not just for those who are new to it but for those who have been in it for a while. We can all learn from each other if we are deliberate about it.</p>
                                        <p>3. An inclusive team is a successful team: Our team is small. We are really like a family. When I joined the team, I didn’t want our team culture to be something that was formed accidentally. We hired a consultant and he helped us craft a team charter; a list of behaviours that we want to model in the office. Our charter is displayed in several places in the office. One of the tenets is inclusiveness. This includes the interns. Whether we are stuffing envelopes at the last minute, having an important meeting or eating cupcakes in celebration of our latest victory, everybody is part of the experience. For our interns, it built their confidence to know that what they bring to the table also matters and has value.</p>
                                        <p>4. Learning should not be accidental: My internship at the Carter Center was one of my first real experiences in the workplace. In my first week in the office, the staff members were informed that the program I was part of had run out of funding and they were soon after dismissed. I stayed on to help phase out the program, working closely with the program director, who invested in teaching me some fundamental lessons about working in that environment. “Elizabeth,” I still remember him saying “if you are going to work in a non-profit you must remember that everyone is a fundraiser.”</p> <p>I’ve never forgotten that lesson. What I learned that summer was immense. My experience, though sad, was also full of great lessons.
                                        We tried to recreate this environment for our interns this year. You are one of their first lessons in leadership: laugh with them, talk to them, listen to them and validate their dreams.</p>
                                        <p>5. Life as a student is difficult: Remember life in university? It was hard. Students have hardly any money for their basic needs. And education is becoming more expensive every year. In my opinion taking free labour from a struggling student is unfair. It’s true they are gaining valuable skills and experience, but it’s important to pay your interns, even if it is only a small stipend. They could really use the money. </p>
                                        <p>When well-structured and organised, internships can be a win/win proposition for organizations and for young entrants to the workplace.</p>
